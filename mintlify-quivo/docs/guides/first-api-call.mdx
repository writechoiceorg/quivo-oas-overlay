title: Making your first API call in 5 minutes
ogDescription: Get started with the Quivo API by making your first authenticated request
---

This tutorial shows you how to make your first API call to the Quivo Connector API. You'll learn how to authenticate and verify your connection.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **API Key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo
- **Username:** Your Quivo account username
- **Password:** Your Quivo account password
- **Base URL:** Your environment URL. See the [references documentation](/docs/references) for environment URLs.

<Note>
**Getting your credentials:** If you don't have an API key yet, see the [Setting up your account](/docs/guides/setup-account) guide. Your username and password are the same credentials you use to log in to The Connector Web App.
</Note>

## Step 1: Authenticate

Authenticate with the API to obtain a session token. Use the `POST /login` endpoint to exchange your credentials for a temporary session token. For more details about authentication and token management, see the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/login" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -d '{
        "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL. Replace the placeholders with your actual API key, username, and password.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The API returns a token string in the response:

    ```json
    {
      "Token": "<YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    }
    ```

    Copy the token value from the `Token` field. You'll use this token in the next step.

    <Note>
      Session tokens expire after one hour. When a token expires, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` error and need to authenticate again.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Make your first API call

Use the `GET /ping` endpoint to verify your authentication is working correctly. This endpoint checks API connectivity and confirms your session token is valid.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/ping" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL. Replace the placeholders with your actual API key and the session token you obtained in Step 1.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with a plain text response:

    ```
    healthy
    ```

    <Note>
      The ping endpoint returns plain text, not JSON. This confirms the API is accessible and your authentication is working correctly.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
