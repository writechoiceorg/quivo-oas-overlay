---

This guide explains what subscriptions are and shows you how to create them to receive real-time event notifications from Quivo. Instead of polling for status changes, subscriptions allow Quivo to push data to your server via an HTTP POST request whenever a specific event occurs.

## What are subscriptions?

Subscriptions are webhook configurations that notify your server when specific events happen in the Quivo system. When you create a subscription, you specify:

- **Entity type**: The type of resource you want to monitor (for example, orders or shipments)
- **Endpoint URL**: The HTTPS endpoint on your server that receives the notification data

When an event occurs for the subscribed entity type, Quivo sends a POST request to your endpoint with event details. Your endpoint must return a `200 OK` response to confirm receipt of the notification.

<Warning>
**Important:** Your webhook endpoint must return a `200 OK` response to confirm receipt of the notification. If your endpoint does not return `200 OK`, Quivo may retry the webhook or mark it as failed.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Session token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **API key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo.
- **Seller ID:** Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) to find it.
- **Public URL:** A secure HTTPS endpoint on your server capable of receiving JSON POST requests.

## Supported entity types

The following table lists the supported entity types and the events that trigger notifications:

| Entity | Triggers On |
|--------|-------------|
| `ORDERS` | Order creation, status changes (for example, to `PROCESSING`). |
| `SHIPMENTS` | Shipment creation, tracking updates (for example, `IN_TRANSIT`, `DELIVERED`). |
| `INBOUNDS` | Inbound shipment status changes. |
| `RETURNS` | When a return is created or received at the warehouse. |
| `INVOICES` | Invoice creation and updates. |

## Create a subscription

Create a subscription when you want to start receiving real-time notifications about specific events. Use the [`POST /subscriptions` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions) to create a new subscription.

You need to construct a JSON payload containing your `sellerId`, the entity type, and the endpoint configuration.

The following example shows how to subscribe to `SHIPMENTS` updates:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to create a webhook subscription for a specific entity.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL: `https://api.quivo.co` for Production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for Sandbox. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The API returns the created subscription object with a unique `uuid` (universally unique identifier). Save this UUID. You need it to delete the subscription later.

    ```json
    {
      "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
      "endpoint": {
        "type": "WEBHOOK",
        "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Request body fields

The request body must include the following fields:

- **`sellerId`** (required): The unique integer ID for your merchant account.
- **`entity`** (required): The entity type you want to subscribe to. Must be one of: `ORDERS`, `SHIPMENTS`, `INBOUNDS`, `RETURNS`, or `INVOICES`.
- **`endpoint`** (required): An object containing:
  - **`type`**: Must be `"WEBHOOK"`.
  - **`url`**: The HTTPS URL of your webhook endpoint that receives notifications.
