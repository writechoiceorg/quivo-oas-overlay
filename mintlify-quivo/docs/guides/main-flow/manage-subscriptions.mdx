---

This guide shows you how to list and delete webhook subscriptions. Use these operations to review your active subscriptions or remove subscriptions you no longer need.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Session token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **API key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo.
- **Subscription UUID:** The UUID of the subscription you want to delete. You can obtain this by listing your subscriptions or from the response when you created the subscription.

## List active subscriptions

List subscriptions when you need to review all webhooks currently configured for your account or find a subscription UUID. Use the [`GET /subscriptions` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions) to retrieve all active subscriptions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to list all active webhook subscriptions for your account.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL: `https://api.quivo.co` for Production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for Sandbox.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The response returns an array of all active subscriptions:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      },
      {
        "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "ORDERS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    Each object in the array represents an active subscription with its UUID, seller ID, entity type, and endpoint configuration.

## Get a specific subscription

To retrieve details for a specific subscription, use the [`GET /subscriptions/{uuid}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions) with the subscription UUID.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to retrieve details for a specific subscription by its UUID.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL: `https://api.quivo.co` for Production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for Sandbox. Replace `<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>` with the UUID of the subscription you want to retrieve.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with the subscription details:

    ```json
    {
      "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
      "endpoint": {
        "type": "WEBHOOK",
        "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Delete a subscription

Delete a subscription when you no longer want to receive notifications for a specific event. Use the subscription UUID obtained when you created it or listed subscriptions. Delete it via the [`DELETE /subscriptions/{uuid}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to delete a webhook subscription by its UUID.

    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL: `https://api.quivo.co` for Production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for Sandbox. Replace `<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>` with the UUID of the subscription you want to delete.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful deletion returns a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` status code with no response body:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
