ogDescription: Generate return labels for your customers and track returned items

Handling returns efficiently is crucial for customer satisfaction. This API allows you to programmatically generate a shipping label that your customer can use to send an item back to the Quivo warehouse.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Session Token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) in the API Reference to find it.
- **Shipping Service Group ID:** The ID representing the carrier/service you want to use for the return. Use the [`GET /shippingServiceGroups` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/shippingServiceGroups) in the API Reference to find it.

## Book a return label

To let a customer return an item, you must generate a shipping label for them via the [`POST /returnApp/book` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/returnApp).

You need to provide the "Ship From" address (your customer's house) and the weight of the package.

The following example shows how to send a complete return request payload in one command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/returnApp/book" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "requestUUID": "<YOUR_REQUEST_UUID>",
        "hash": "<YOUR_SECURE_HASH>",
        "reference": "<YOUR_REFERENCE>",
        "grossWeightKG": <GROSS_WEIGHT_KG>,
        "shipFrom": {
          "name": "<CUSTOMER_NAME>",
          "street": "<CUSTOMER_STREET_ADDRESS>",
          "city": "<CUSTOMER_CITY>",
          "zip": "<CUSTOMER_ZIP_CODE>",
          "countryIso2": "<CUSTOMER_COUNTRY_CODE>",
          "email": "<CUSTOMER_EMAIL>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment web address before running requests and replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with a response containing the tracking number and URLs to the PDF label (`labelUrls`). You should email this link or file to your customer.

    ```json
    {
      "status": "OK",
      "trackingNumber": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
      "labelUrls": [
        "<LABEL_URL>"
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Track received returns

When the package arrives back at the Quivo warehouse, the staff inspects it. You can list all received returns to see their status and condition via the [`GET /returns` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/returns).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/returns?sort=created:desc" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment web address before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The response returns an array of `ReturnShipmentSummary` objects. The following example shows the structure of a return in the array:

    ```json
    {
      "returnShipmentId": <YOUR_RETURN_SHIPMENT_ID>,
      "returnShipmentIdentifier": "<YOUR_RETURN_SHIPMENT_IDENTIFIER>",
      "returnShipmentReference": "<YOUR_REFERENCE>",
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "warehouseId": <YOUR_WAREHOUSE_ID>,
      "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>,
      "trackingNumber": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
      "trackingLink": "<TRACKING_LINK>",
      "receivedDate": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "customerExamined": false,
      "positions": [
        {
          "sellerSku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
          "warehouseSku": "<WAREHOUSE_SKU>",
          "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
          "quantity": <QUANTITY>,
          "classCode": "<CLASS_CODE>",
          "reasonCode": "<REASON_CODE>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  
    The response (`ReturnShipmentSummary`) contains critical information for processing refunds. Timestamps use the ISO 8601 pattern YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ in Coordinated Universal Time.

    - `returnShipmentReference`: Matches the reference you provided, for example `"<YOUR_REFERENCE>"`.
    - `positions`: Lists the items inside the box.
    - `customerExamined`: A boolean indicating if the warehouse has finished inspecting the item.
    - `reasonCode` / `classCode`: If available, details on why it was returned and its condition.
