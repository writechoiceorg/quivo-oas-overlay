Handling returns efficiently is crucial for customer satisfaction. This API allows you to programmatically generate a shipping label that your customer can use to send an item back to the Quivo warehouse.

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
**API Version:** v1 (Connector)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Authentication Token:** A valid Bearer token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use `GET /sellers` to find it.
- **Shipping Service Group ID:** The ID representing the carrier/service you want to use for the return. Use `GET /shippingServiceGroups` to find it.

## Conventions

Throughout this guide:
- Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL (for example, `https://api.quivo.co` for production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for sandbox).
- Replace all placeholders (for example, `<YOUR_SELLER_ID>`, `<GROSS_WEIGHT_KG>`) with your actual values. IDs and quantities should be integers; numeric values like weights should be numbers (decimals); all other placeholders should be strings.

## Step 1: Book a return label

To let a customer return an item, you must generate a shipping label for them via the endpoint: `POST /returnApp/book`

You need to provide the "Ship From" address (your customer's house) and the weight of the package.

The following example shows a complete return request payload. Replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```json
{
  "requestUUID": "<YOUR_REQUEST_UUID>",
  "hash": "<YOUR_SECURE_HASH>",
  "reference": "<YOUR_REFERENCE>",
  "grossWeightKG": <GROSS_WEIGHT_KG>,
  "shipFrom": {
    "name": "<CUSTOMER_NAME>",
    "street": "<CUSTOMER_STREET_ADDRESS>",
    "city": "<CUSTOMER_CITY>",
    "zip": "<CUSTOMER_ZIP_CODE>",
    "countryIso2": "<CUSTOMER_COUNTRY_CODE>",
    "email": "<CUSTOMER_EMAIL>"
  }
}
```


### Send the request

Send a POST request to the `/returnApp/book` endpoint with your payload. Include your API key and session token in the headers. Replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/returnApp/book" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '@return_payload.json'
```

The request should return a 200 OK status code with a response containing the tracking number and URLs to the PDF label (`labelUrls`). You should email this link or file to your customer.

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "trackingNumber": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
  "labelUrls": [
    "<LABEL_URL>"
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Track received returns

When the package arrives back at the Quivo warehouse, the staff inspects it. You can list all received returns to see their status and condition via the endpoint: `GET /returns`

The example below shows a request to get the latest returns.

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/returns?sort=created:desc" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
```

The response returns an array of `ReturnShipmentSummary` objects. The following example shows the structure of a return in the array:

```json
{
  "returnShipmentId": <YOUR_RETURN_SHIPMENT_ID>,
  "returnShipmentIdentifier": "<YOUR_RETURN_SHIPMENT_IDENTIFIER>",
  "returnShipmentReference": "<YOUR_REFERENCE>",
  "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
  "warehouseId": <YOUR_WAREHOUSE_ID>,
  "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>,
  "trackingNumber": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
  "trackingLink": "<TRACKING_LINK>",
  "receivedDate": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
  "customerExamined": false,
  "positions": [
    {
      "sellerSku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "warehouseSku": "<WAREHOUSE_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>,
      "classCode": "<CLASS_CODE>",
      "reasonCode": "<REASON_CODE>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding the return data

The response (`ReturnShipmentSummary`) contains critical information for processing refunds:

- `returnShipmentReference`: Matches the reference you provided (for example, `"<YOUR_REFERENCE>"`).
- `positions`: Lists the items inside the box.
- `customerExamined`: A boolean indicating if the warehouse has finished inspecting the item.
- `reasonCode` / `classCode`: (If available) Details on why it was returned (for example, `"Damaged"`, `"Wrong Size"`) and its condition (for example, `"A-Stock"`, `"B-Stock"`).

## Troubleshooting

- **400 Bad Request:** This error usually indicates a missing required field (for example, you omitted `hash`, `grossWeightKG`, or `shipFrom`). Check your payload against the required fields.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Your token is invalid or has expired. Repeat the authentication step to generate a new token.
- **404 Not Found:** The `hash` you provided is invalid, or the `returnShipmentId` does not exist. Verify your hash value or ensure you are using the correct return shipment ID.
