ogDescription: Notify the Quivo warehouse that you are sending a shipment of products (stock)
---

This tutorial guides you step by step through creating an "Inbound" record to notify the Quivo warehouse team that you are sending products. To fulfill orders, you need inventory available in a Quivo warehouse. This API flow creates an inbound record so the warehouse can plan for the arrival and process the inventory.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Session token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) to find it.
- **Warehouse ID:** Use the [`GET /warehouses` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/warehouses) to list available warehouses.
- **Product SKUs:** The items you are sending must already exist. Use the [`GET /articles` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/articles) to find them.

## Create the inbound request

Create an inbound record when you are preparing to send products to a Quivo warehouse. You must tell the warehouse exactly what’s coming so they can plan for its arrival using the [`POST /inbounds` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/inbounds).

The following example shows a complete inbound payload with all required fields and some common optional fields.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to create a new inbound record and notify the warehouse about incoming stock.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/inbounds" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "warehouseId": <YOUR_WAREHOUSE_ID>,
        "deliverySlipNumber": "<YOUR_DELIVERY_SLIP_NUMBER>",
        "estimatedArrivalTime": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
        "trackingNumber": "<YOUR_TRACKING_NUMBER>",
        "carrier": "<YOUR_CARRIER>",
        "deliveryInfo": {
          "cargoType": "CARTON",
          "quantity": <NUMBER_OF_CARTONS>
        },
        "inboundPositions": [
          {
            "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
            "quantity": <QUANTITY>
          },
          {
            "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
            "quantity": <QUANTITY>
          }
        ],
        "shipFrom": {
          "company": "<YOUR_COMPANY_NAME>",
          "address1": "<YOUR_STREET_ADDRESS>",
          "city": "<YOUR_CITY>",
          "country": "<YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE>",
          "zip": "<YOUR_ZIP_CODE>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code.

    ```json
    {
      "status": "OK",
      "inboundId": <YOUR_INBOUND_ID>,
      "message": "Inbound created successfully"
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      **Important:** Save the `inboundId` returned in the response. You may need to print this ID on the shipping label so the warehouse can identify the boxes when they arrive.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

<Tip>
  For the complete inbound request schema—including all required and optional fields—see the [Inbounds section in the API Reference](/api-reference/#tag/inbounds).
</Tip>

## Track inbound status

After creating an inbound record, use this endpoint to monitor the processing status. Once your shipment arrives, the warehouse team starts scanning the items. Check the status of this process via the API using the [`GET /inbounds/{inboundId}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/inbounds).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to retrieve the current status of an existing inbound by its ID.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/inbounds/<YOUR_INBOUND_ID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The response returns an `InboundGet` object with details about the inbound:

    ```json
    {
      "id": <YOUR_INBOUND_ID>,
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "warehouseId": <YOUR_WAREHOUSE_ID>,
      "shopId": <YOUR_SHOP_ID>,
      "inboundStatus": "PROCESSING",
      "deliverySlipNumber": "<YOUR_DELIVERY_SLIP_NUMBER>",
      "estimatedArrivalTime": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "trackingNumber": "<YOUR_TRACKING_NUMBER>",
      "carrier": "<YOUR_CARRIER>",
      "created": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "completedAt": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "shipFrom": {
        "company": "<YOUR_COMPANY_NAME>",
        "address1": "<YOUR_STREET_ADDRESS>",
        "city": "<YOUR_CITY>",
        "country": "<YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE>",
        "zip": "<YOUR_ZIP_CODE>"
      },
      "deliveryInfo": {
        "cargoType": "CARTON",
        "quantity": <NUMBER_OF_CARTONS>
      },
      "inboundPositions": [
        {
          "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
          "quantity": <QUANTITY>
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Look for the `inboundStatus` field in the response to see the current status of the inbound:

    - `PENDING`: The inbound request is pending processing.
    - `CREATED`: You have notified Quivo, but the package hasn't arrived.
    - `PROCESSING`: The warehouse is currently counting and booking the stock.
    - `COMPLETED`: All items are booked into inventory and ready to be sold. If the inbound is completed, you can start the next step to create the order.
    - `CANCELLED`: The inbound has been cancelled.
