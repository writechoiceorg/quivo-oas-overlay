ogDescription: Programmatically submit a new fulfillment order to the Quivo Connector using the REST (Representational State Transfer) API

This guide shows you how to trigger a "Pick & Pack" process in the warehouse for your product.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Session Token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api/orders/get-sellers) in the API Reference to find it.
- **Product SKU:** You must have created at least one product in the system via the [`POST /articles` endpoint](/api/orders/create-article) before you can order it. SKU stands for stock keeping unit.

## Create the order request

To create an order, construct a JSON object that matches the `OrderPost` schema using the [`POST /orders` endpoint](/api/orders/create-order).

You must provide four main fields in the payload:

1. **Seller Context:** Identifies the merchant account (`sellerId`).
2. **Order Identifiers:** Unique IDs to track the order and prevent duplicates (`orderIdentifier` and `orderReference`).
3. **Delivery Address:** The destination for the package (`deliveryAddress`).
4. **Order Positions:** The list of items to ship (`positions`), including SKUs, names, and quantities.

The following example shows an order payload with all required fields:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/orders" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "orderIdentifier": "<YOUR_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>",
        "orderReference": "<YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE>",
        "deliveryAddress": {
          "company": "<YOUR_COMPANY_NAME>",
          "name": "<RECIPIENT_NAME>",
          "email": "<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>",
          "street": "<YOUR_STREET_ADDRESS>",
          "city": "<YOUR_CITY>",
          "zip": "<YOUR_ZIP_CODE>",
          "countryIso2": "<YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE>"
        },
        "positions": [
          {
            "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
            "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
            "quantity": <QUANTITY>
          },
          {
            "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
            "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
            "quantity": <QUANTITY>
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment web address before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code and an `OrderPostResult` object.

    ```json
    {
      "status": "OK",
      "message": "Order created successfully",
      "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>
    }
    ```

    Capture the `orderId` from the response. You need this ID to track the order status later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Required fields:** Include `sellerId`, `orderIdentifier`, `orderReference`, `deliveryAddress`, and `positions`. You can find the full schema including optional fields in the [API Reference](/api-reference/#tag/orders).
</Tip>

## Next steps

Now that you have created the order, the warehouse team receives the Pick & Pack instruction automatically. Continue with these guides:
