title: Create a Fulfillment Order
description: Programmatically submit a new fulfillment order to the Quivo Connector using the REST API
---

By the end of this guide, you have successfully triggered a "Pick & Pack" process in the warehouse for your product.

**Time to complete:** 10 minutes  
**API Version:** v1 (Connector)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Authentication Token:** A valid Bearer token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use `GET /sellers` to find it.
- **Product SKU:** You must have created at least one product in the system via the endpoint `POST /articles` before you can order it.

## Conventions

Throughout this guide:
- Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL (for example, `https://api.quivo.co` for production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for sandbox).
- Replace all placeholders (for example, `<YOUR_SELLER_ID>`, `<YOUR_ORDER_ID>`) with your actual values. IDs and quantities should be integers; all other placeholders should be strings.

## Step 1: Prepare the order payload

To create an order, construct a JSON object that matches the `OrderPost` schema.

You must provide four main components in the payload:

1. **Seller Context:** Identifies the merchant account.
2. **Identifiers:** Unique IDs to track the order and prevent duplicates.
3. **Recipient:** The destination for the package (`deliveryAddress`).
4. **Content:** The list of items to ship (`positions`).

### Required fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `sellerId` | Integer | The ID of your merchant account. |
| `orderIdentifier` | String | A unique ID from your shop (for example, `"SHOPIFY-1001"`). Use this to prevent duplicate orders. |
| `orderReference` | String | The reference visible to the end customer (for example, `"#DE38678"`). |
| `deliveryAddress` | Object | Contains `street`, `city`, `countryIso2` (2-letter code), and the recipient's name. |
| `positions` | Array | A list of items. For each item, you must specify `sku`, `name`, and `quantity`. |

The following example shows a complete order request payload. Replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```json
{
  "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
  "orderIdentifier": "<YOUR_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>",
  "orderReference": "<YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE>",
  "deliveryAddress": {
    "company": "<YOUR_COMPANY_NAME>",
    "name": "<RECIPIENT_NAME>",
    "email": "<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>",
    "street": "<YOUR_STREET_ADDRESS>",
    "city": "<YOUR_CITY>",
    "zip": "<YOUR_ZIP_CODE>",
    "countryIso2": "<YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE>"
  },
  "positions": [
    {
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>
    },
    {
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>
    }
  ]
}
```


## Step 2: Send the request

Submit the payload to the `/orders` endpoint using `POST` following the example below. You must include both the `X-Api-Key` and the `Authorization` token in your headers.

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/orders" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '@payload.json'
```

## Step 3: Handle the response

When the request succeeds, the API returns a 200 OK status code and an `OrderPostResult` object.

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>
}
```
Capture the `orderId` from the response. You need this ID to track the order status later.

### Common errors

| Status Code | Description | Solution |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `400 Bad Request` | This error usually indicates a missing required field (for example, you omitted `countryIso2`). | Check your payload against the schema. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Your token is invalid or has expired. | Repeat Step 1 to generate a new token. |
| `404 Not Found` | The `sku` you provided in `positions` does not exist in the warehouse system. | Verify your product list. |
| `409 Conflict` | An order with this `orderIdentifier` already exists. | Ensure you generate unique identifiers for each new order. |

## Next steps

Now that you have created the order, the warehouse team receives the Pick & Pack instruction automatically.

- **Track order status:** Use `GET /orders/{orderId}` to monitor when the order status changes to `SHIPPED`.
- **Manage webhooks:** Set up a subscription to receive automatic notifications when the system generates a tracking number.
