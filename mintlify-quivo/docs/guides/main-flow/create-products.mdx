An article is a product in the Quivo system. Each article must have a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) that identifies it. You must create articles before you can send them as inventory to warehouses or include them in fulfillment orders.

This guide teaches you how to create your first article.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Session Token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) in the API Reference to find it.

## Create your first article

To create an article, use the [`POST /articles/{sellerId}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/articles). The only required field is `sku`, but providing additional information helps with fulfillment operations.

The following example shows how to create an article with essential fields:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/articles/<YOUR_SELLER_ID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
        "name": {
          "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
          "language": "EN"
        },
        "grossWeight": {
          "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "KG"
        },
        "length": {
          "value": <LENGTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "width": {
          "value": <WIDTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "height": {
          "value": <HEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "countryOfOrigin": "<COUNTRY_CODE>",
        "salesPrice": {
          "value": <PRICE_VALUE>,
          "currencyCode": "<CURRENCY_CODE>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with an `ArticleGetDetail` object:

    ```json
    {
      "articleId": <YOUR_ARTICLE_ID>,
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": {
        "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
        "language": "EN"
      },
      "grossWeight": {
        "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
        "unit": "KG"
      },
      "created": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "lastModified": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>"
    }
    ```

    Save the `articleId` from the response. You need this ID to update the article or upload images later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Optional fields:** Only `sku` is required. The example above shows essential fields for fulfillment operations. For a complete list of all available optional fields (including `barcode`, `customsValue`, `alternativeNames`, and more), see the [API Reference](/api-reference/#tag/articles).
