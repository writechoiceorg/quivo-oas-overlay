This tutorial guides you step by step through creating your first article. An article is a product in the Quivo system. Each article must have a unique stock keeping unit (SKU) that identifies it. You must create articles before you can send them as inventory to warehouses or include them in fulfillment orders.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Session token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** Use the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) to find it.

## Create your first article

To create an article, use the [`POST /articles/{sellerId}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/articles). You only need `sku`, but providing additional information helps with fulfillment operations.

The following example shows how to create an article with essential fields:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request example to create a new article with essential product data.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/articles/<YOUR_SELLER_ID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
        "name": {
          "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
          "language": "EN"
        },
        "grossWeight": {
          "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "KG"
        },
        "length": {
          "value": <LENGTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "width": {
          "value": <WIDTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "height": {
          "value": <HEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "countryOfOrigin": "<COUNTRY_CODE>",
        "salesPrice": {
          "value": <PRICE_VALUE>,
          "currencyCode": "<CURRENCY_CODE>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with an `ArticleGetDetail` object:

    ```json
    {
      "articleId": <YOUR_ARTICLE_ID>,
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": {
        "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
        "language": "EN"
      },
      "grossWeight": {
        "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
        "unit": "KG"
      },
      "created": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "lastModified": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>"
    }
    ```

    Save the `articleId` from the response. You need this ID to update the article or upload images later. Timestamps follow the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 8601 pattern YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ, where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the month, DD is the day, HH:mm:ss is the time, and Z means Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

<Tip>
  **Optional fields:** You only need `sku`. The preceding example shows essential fields for fulfillment operations. For a complete list of optional fields—including `barcode`, `customsValue`, `alternativeNames`, and more—see the [API Reference](/api-reference/#tag/articles).
