title: Track an Order
description: Retrieve the current status and tracking information for a fulfillment order
---

By the end of this guide, you know how to programmatically check if an order has been shipped and retrieve the carrier's tracking link to share with your customer.

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
**API Version:** v1 (Connector)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Authentication Token:** A valid Bearer token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Order ID:** The unique integer `orderId` returned when you created the order.

## Conventions

Throughout this guide:
- Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL (for example, `https://api.quivo.co` for production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for sandbox).
- Replace all placeholders (for example, `<YOUR_ORDER_ID>`, `<QUANTITY>`) with your actual values. IDs and quantities should be integers; all other placeholders should be strings.

## Step 1: Get order details

To track an order, retrieve its full details using its unique ID via the endpoint: `GET /orders/<YOUR_ORDER_ID>`

Following the example below, replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/orders/<YOUR_ORDER_ID>" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Step 2: Analyze the response

If the request is successful (200 OK), the API returns a JSON object containing the order's current state. Focus on two specific sections: the status and the tracking information.

Locate the `orderStatus` field in the response body. This field indicates where the order is in the fulfillment lifecycle.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | The order has been received but processing has not yet started. |
| `PROCESSING` | The warehouse is currently picking and packing the items. |
| `COMPLETED` | The order has been packed and handed over to the carrier. |
| `CANCELLED` | The order was cancelled before fulfillment. |

Once the status changes to `COMPLETED`, the system generates tracking information. Find this in the `shipmentTracking` array.

- `number`: The tracking number assigned by the carrier (for example, DHL, UPS).
- `link`: A direct URL to the carrier's tracking page.

The following JSON example shows a successful response for a shipped order. Note that `orderStatus` is `COMPLETED` and the `shipmentTracking` array contains the link.

```json
{
  "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>,
  "orderIdentifier": "<YOUR_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>",
  "orderReference": "<YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE>",
  "orderStatus": "COMPLETED",
  "orderDate": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
  "completedAt": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
  "shippingMethodName": "<SHIPPING_METHOD_NAME>",
  "shipmentTracking": [
    {
      "number": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
      "link": "<TRACKING_LINK>"
    }
  ],
  "positions": [
    {
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>
    }
  ]
}
```


## Troubleshooting

- **404 Not Found:** The `orderId` does not exist. Ensure you are using the internal Quivo ID (integer), not your custom `orderIdentifier` string.
- **Empty tracking array:** If `orderStatus` is `COMPLETED` but `shipmentTracking` is empty, the carrier may not have generated the tracking number yet. Retry the request after a few minutes.
