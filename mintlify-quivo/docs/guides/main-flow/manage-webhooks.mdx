This guide shows you how to create, list, and delete webhook subscriptions to receive real-time notifications from Quivo. Instead of polling for status changes, Quivo pushes data to your server via an HTTP POST request whenever a specific event occurs.

<Warning>
**Important:** Your webhook endpoint must return a `200 OK` response to confirm receipt of the notification. If your endpoint does not return `200 OK`, Quivo may retry the webhook or mark it as failed.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Session token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **API key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account.
- **Public URL:** A secure HTTPS endpoint on your server capable of receiving JSON POST requests.

## Create a subscription

Create a subscription when you want to start receiving real-time notifications about specific events. You must tell Quivo which entity to watch and where to send the data via the [`POST /subscriptions` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions).

The following table lists the supported entities and the events that trigger them:

| Entity | Triggers On |
|--------|-------------|
| `ORDERS` | Order creation, status changes (for example, to `PROCESSING`). |
| `SHIPMENTS` | Shipment creation, tracking updates (for example, `IN_TRANSIT`, `DELIVERED`). |
| `INBOUNDS` | Inbound shipment status changes. |
| `RETURNS` | When a return is created or received at the warehouse. |
| `INVOICES` | Invoice creation and updates. |

You need to construct a JSON payload containing your `sellerId`, the entity type, and the endpoint configuration.

The following example shows how to subscribe to `SHIPMENTS` updates:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to create a webhook subscription for a specific entity.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      }'
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests and replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The API returns the created subscription object with a unique `uuid` (universally unique identifier). Save this UUID. You need it to delete the subscription later.

    ```json
    {
      "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
      "endpoint": {
        "type": "WEBHOOK",
        "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## List active subscriptions

List subscriptions when you need to review all webhooks currently configured for your account or find a subscription UUID. Use the [`GET /subscriptions` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions).

The following example shows how to list all active subscriptions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to list all active webhook subscriptions for your account.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests and replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The response returns an array of all active subscriptions:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "SHIPMENTS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      },
      {
        "uuid": "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>",
        "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "entity": "ORDERS",
        "endpoint": {
          "type": "WEBHOOK",
          "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Delete a subscription

Delete a subscription when you no longer want to receive notifications for a specific event. Use the subscription UUID obtained when you created it or listed subscriptions. Delete it via the [`DELETE /subscriptions/{uuid}` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/subscriptions).

The following example shows how to delete a subscription using its `uuid`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use this request to delete a webhook subscription by its UUID.

    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "${BASE_URL}/subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_UUID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with the correct base URL configured for your account before running requests and replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful deletion returns a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` status code with no response body:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
