An article is a product in the Quivo system. Each article must have a unique stock keeping unit (SKU) that identifies it. You must create articles before you can send them as inventory to warehouses or include them in fulfillment orders.

This guide teaches you how to create your first article.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Session Token:** A valid session token. See the Authentication guide at /api-reference/authentication to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use the `GET /sellers` endpoint in the API Reference at /api-reference/#tag/sellers to find it.

## Create your first article

To create an article, use the `POST /articles/{sellerId}` endpoint in the API Reference at /api-reference/#tag/articles. You only need `sku`, but providing additional information helps with fulfillment operations.

The following example shows how to create an article with essential fields:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/articles/<YOUR_SELLER_ID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
        "name": {
          "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
          "language": "EN"
        },
        "grossWeight": {
          "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "KG"
        },
        "length": {
          "value": <LENGTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "width": {
          "value": <WIDTH_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "height": {
          "value": <HEIGHT_VALUE>,
          "unit": "CM"
        },
        "countryOfOrigin": "<COUNTRY_CODE>",
        "salesPrice": {
          "value": <PRICE_VALUE>,
          "currencyCode": "<CURRENCY_CODE>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment web address before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with an `ArticleGetDetail` object:

    ```json
    {
      "articleId": <YOUR_ARTICLE_ID>,
      "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": {
        "value": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
        "language": "EN"
      },
      "grossWeight": {
        "value": <WEIGHT_VALUE>,
        "unit": "KG"
      },
      "created": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "lastModified": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>"
    }
    ```

    Save the `articleId` from the response. You need this ID to update the article or upload images later. Timestamps follow the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 8601 pattern YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ, where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the month, DD is the day, HH:mm:ss is the time, and Z means Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Optional fields:** You only need `sku`. The preceding example shows essential fields for fulfillment operations. For a complete list of optional fields—including `barcode`, `customsValue`, `alternativeNames`, and more—see the API Reference at /api-reference/#tag/articles.
