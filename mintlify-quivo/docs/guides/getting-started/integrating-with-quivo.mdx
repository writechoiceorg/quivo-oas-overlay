---

This concept page explains how to access The Connector, understand your credentials, find your Seller ID, and choose the right environment before building with the Quivo API. For step-by-step authentication, see the [Making your first API call](/docs/guides/getting-started/first-api-call) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Merchant account:** Provisioned by Quivo.
- **Connector Web App access:** Ability to sign in to The Connector.
- **API credentials:** Static API key, username, and password issued by Quivo.
- **Seller ID:** Your merchant identifier (needed for API operations).

<Note>
If you need a merchant account or Connector access, contact Quivo support.
</Note>

## Access The Connector
- Sign in to The Connector Web App with your Quivo credentials.
- Manage logistics operations and, when provided, retrieve your API key from the web app.

## Credential model (concept)
- **Static API key:** Provided by Quivo; send in the `X-Api-Key` header.
- **Username and password:** Your Quivo login; used with the API key to obtain a session token.
- **Session token:** Obtained via `POST /login`; send in the `Authorization` header for API calls.

For authentication flows and header examples, see the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).

## Getting an API key (concept)
- Quivo issues your static API key during onboarding or via The Connector.
- Detailed, step-by-step API key request flows (UI or API) live in the separate How-To: [Request an API Key](/docs/guides/getting-started/request-api-key).

## Find your Seller ID
- Your Seller ID uniquely scopes API operations to your merchant account.
- Retrieve it via the [`GET /sellers` endpoint](/api-reference/#tag/sellers) after you have a session token.

## Choose your environment
- Use the correct `${BASE_URL}` configured for your account.
- Keep base URLs, API keys, and session tokens separate per environment. An API key is always required in the `X-Api-Key` header.
