ogDescription: Learn about Quivo and how these guides can help you integrate with the Quivo logistics platform
---

This overview explains what Quivo is and how the platform is structured. For step-by-step instructions, see the [Making your first API call tutorial](/docs/guides/getting-started/first-api-call) and the core workflow guides.

Quivo is a third-party logistics provider (3PL) created from the merger of LOGSTA and ANCLA (PackAngels). It operates fulfillment centers in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and partner hubs with GWC Group (Gulf Warehousing Company Group) in the Gulf region, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Oman.

The Quivo platform combines warehouse operations with the Quivo Connector, which exposes APIs and integrations to manage the order lifecycle from inventory intake to delivery. The platform integrates with multiple shop systems, including Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Amazon FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant), TikTok, Wix, Shopware, and PrestaShop, and with shipping providers such as Royal Mail, DHL (Deutsche Post DHL Group), DPD (Dynamic Parcel Distribution), and FedEx.

## Ecosystem

Quivo offers two primary service models. The Quivo API supports both models and provides access to Quivo transport services.

### Fulfillment Service

In the Fulfillment Service model, Quivo manages the entire logistics process on behalf of the merchant. This includes:

- Storing products in Quivo's dedicated fulfillment centers
- Handling order processing, packaging, and shipping directly to customers
- Seamless integration with over 40 shop and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Customized packaging options
- Returns management

### Send It Yourself
The Send It Yourself (SIY) model serves merchants who handle storage, packing, and shipping themselves. Through the Quivo Connector, merchants can:

- Integrate their online shop systems
- Compare shipping options
- Print shipping labels
- Manage shipments efficiently

### Transport services
Quivo transport services support both service models and include pallet and container transport via truck, air, or sea freight.

## API integration

Quivo exposes APIs to manage inventory, orders, and shipments. These APIs serve as the technical foundation of the Quivo platform. You can find the API reference [here](/api-reference/introduction).
