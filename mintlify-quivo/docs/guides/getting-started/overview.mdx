Quivo also operates partner hubs with GWC Group (Gulf Warehousing Company Group) in the Gulf region, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Oman. 

The Quivo platform combines logistics operations with the Quivo Connector to provide end-to-end e-commerce integrations and management for clients. The platform manages the complete order lifecycle from inventory management to doorstep delivery through a 360° fulfillment software with 40+ shop system integrations, including Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Amazon FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant), TikTok, Wix, Shopware, and PrestaShop. The platform also integrates with major shipping providers, including Royal Mail, DHL (Deutsche Post DHL Group), DPD (Dynamic Parcel Distribution), and FedEx, offering flexible shipping options and real-time tracking.

## Ecosystem

Quivo offers two primary service models to accommodate different e-commerce logistics needs. The Quivo API supports both models and provides access to Quivo's transport services for international transportation solutions.

### Fulfillment Service

In the Fulfillment Service model, Quivo manages the entire logistics process on behalf of the merchant. This includes:

- Storing products in Quivo's dedicated fulfillment centers
- Handling order processing, packaging, and shipping directly to customers
- Seamless integration with over 40 shop and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Customized packaging options
- Returns management

This comprehensive service enables businesses to focus on growth while Quivo handles all logistics operations. The Fulfillment Service model is ideal for businesses that want to outsource their fulfillment operations completely.

### Send It Yourself

The Send It Yourself (SIY) model serves merchants who prefer to handle storage, packing, and shipping themselves but wish to leverage Quivo's discounted shipping rates and logistics tools. Through the Quivo Connector, merchants can:

- Integrate their online shop systems
- Compare shipping options
- Print shipping labels
- Manage shipments efficiently

This model offers flexibility and cost savings, especially for businesses with lower shipping volumes or those seeking more control over their logistics processes. The Send It Yourself model is ideal for businesses in the early stages of growth or those looking to maintain direct control over their fulfillment process while benefiting from Quivo's technology and shipping partnerships.

### Transport services

Quivo's transport services support both service models and provide flexible and secure international transportation solutions. This includes pallet and container transport via truck, air, or sea freight.

## API integration

Quivo offers a comprehensive API to manage your inventory, orders, and shipments. This API is available for all clients to use and serves as the foundation of the Quivo platform. The following guides walk you through the main workflows for integrating with Quivo. You can find the API reference [here](/api-reference/introduction).
