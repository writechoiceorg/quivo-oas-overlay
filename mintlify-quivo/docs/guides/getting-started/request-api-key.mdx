ogDescription: Request and track your Quivo Connector API key via the UI or API
---

This how-to shows two ways to request and track your Quivo API key: through The Connector web app (UI) or via the API. If you already have your key, proceed to [Making your first API call](/docs/guides/getting-started/first-api-call).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Connector Web App access:** To use the UI flow.
- **Credentials:** Your Quivo login for The Connector.
- **API access (for API flow):** Ability to call authenticated endpoints. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).

## Request your API key

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI (Connector Web App)">

1. Sign in to The Connector Web App.
2. In the left sidebar, open Settings.
3. Click Request API Key.
4. Submit the request and wait for approval.
5. After approval, the API Key field appears on this page; use the copy icon to copy it.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">

### Get your Seller ID

If you don’t know your Seller ID, retrieve it after authenticating.

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/sellers" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
```

Key fields in the response:

- `id`: Your Seller ID (integer)
- `status`: One of `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `TERMINATED`, `NEW`, `PENDING`

### Request the API key

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/apiKeyRequests/{sellerId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Replace `{sellerId}` with your Seller ID.

### Check request status

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/apiKeyRequests" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
- Use the correct `${BASE_URL}` configured for your account.
- Contact Quivo support if you hit authentication issues or if your request is stalled.
</Note>

## Check status & retrieve your key

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI (Connector Web App)">

After approval, sign back into The Connector and retrieve the API key from the Request API Keys section. Use the copy icon to copy the key.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">

Periodically call `GET /apiKeyRequests` and inspect each request’s `status` field:

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/apiKeyRequests" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
```

The response contains an array of requests with `status` values such as `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, or `EXPIRED`. When the status for your request changes to `APPROVED`, check whether the response includes the key in the `value` field; if it does, store it securely and start using it in the `X-Api-Key` header. If the key isn’t exposed in the response, contact Quivo support.
