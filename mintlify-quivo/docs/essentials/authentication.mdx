description: Learn how to authenticate your requests to the Quivo API
---

All requests to the Quivo API require authentication using a session token. This guide explains how to obtain and use this token.

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
**API Version:** v1 (Connector)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **API Key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo
- **Username:** Your Quivo account username
- **Password:** Your Quivo account password

## Conventions

Throughout this guide:
- Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL (for example, `https://api.quivo.co` for production or `https://api-sandbox.quivo.co` for sandbox).
- Replace all placeholders (for example, `<YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>`, `<YOUR_USERNAME>`) with your actual values.

## Step 1: Obtain a session token

You must authenticate every request to the Quivo API with a session token. Exchange your credentials for this token via the endpoint `POST /login`.

The token remains valid for **one hour**. After expiration, you need to generate a new token.

Following the example below, replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
  }'
```

The API returns a token string. You must use this token in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.

## Step 2: Use the token in requests

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of all API requests. You must also include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header.

```bash
curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/orders" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Automate token refreshing. Because the token expires after one hour, your integration should verify the API response. If you receive a 401 Unauthorized error, your script should automatically repeat the login step to generate a new token.
</Tip>

## Token expiration

Session tokens expire after **1 hour**. When a token expires, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` error response.

### Handling token expiration

When you receive a 401 error:

1. **Automatically retry authentication:** Call `POST /login` again to obtain a new token
2. **Retry the original request:** Use the new token to retry the request that failed


## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized:** Your token is invalid or has expired. Generate a new token using `POST /login`.
- **400 Bad Request:** Check that you're including both `username` and `password` in the request body, and that the `X-Api-Key` header is present.
