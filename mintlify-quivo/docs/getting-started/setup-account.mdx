---

This guide walks you through setting up your merchant account in The Connector, Quivo's platform for managing logistics operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Merchant Account:** A merchant account with Quivo
- **Connector Web App Access:** Access to The Connector Web App
- **Seller ID:** Your seller ID
- **API Key:** Your API key

<Note>
**Account Registration:** Contact Quivo support to create a merchant account and obtain access to The Connector Web App.
</Note>

## Request an API key

To use The Connector API, you need an API key. If you don't have one yet, you can request it through The Connector Web App or through the API.

### Option 1: Request through The Connector Web App

You can request an API key through The Connector Web App:

1. Log in to The Connector Web App
2. Navigate to Settings in the sidebar
3. Find the option to request an API key
4. Submit your request

### Option 2: Request through the API

You can also request an API key through the API. You need your seller ID to make this request.

#### Step 1: Get your seller ID

Your seller ID is a unique integer identifier for your merchant account.

If you don't know your seller ID, use the `GET /sellers` endpoint after you have authenticated. The [Making your first API call](/docs/getting-started/first-api-call) tutorial shows you how to authenticate and obtain a session token.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/sellers" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with an array of seller objects:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
        "identifier": "<SELLER_IDENTIFIER>",
        "name": "<SELLER_NAME>",
        "companyName": "<COMPANY_NAME>",
        "sendToEmail": "<EMAIL_ADDRESS>",
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "warehouseId": <WAREHOUSE_ID>,
        "usesWarehouseSku": false,
        "sellerServices": []
      }
    ]
    ```

    The `id` field contains your seller ID. The `status` field can be one of: `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `TERMINATED`, `NEW`, or `PENDING`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Contact Quivo support if you need assistance finding your seller ID.

#### Step 2: Request the API key

Use the `POST /apiKeyRequests/{sellerId}` endpoint to request an API key for your account.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/apiKeyRequests/{sellerId}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `{sellerId}` with your seller ID and `${BASE_URL}` with your environment address.
      
      Contact Quivo support if you encounter authentication errors.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code. The API returns a boolean value indicating whether the request was successful:

    ```json
    true
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Step 3: Check request status

You can check the status of your API key request using the `GET /apiKeyRequests` endpoint.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/apiKeyRequests" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL before running requests. Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code with an array of API key request objects:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": <REQUEST_ID>,
        "initiator": "<INITIATOR_NAME>",
        "sellerName": "<SELLER_NAME>",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "comment": "<COMMENT>",
        "approvedBy": null,
        "value": null
      }
    ]
    ```

    The `status` field can be one of: `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `PENDING`, `DELETED`, or `EXPIRED`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
API key requests have status values including `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, and `REJECTED`. Contact Quivo support if you need assistance with your API key request.
</Note>

## Retrieve your API key

After Quivo approves your API key request, you can retrieve your API key from The Connector Web App. Quivo provides your API key during account setup or after approving your API key request.

### Access The Connector Web App

The Connector Web App is the web interface for managing your Quivo account. You use the same username and password to log in to The Connector Web App as you use for API authentication.

<Note>
Quivo provides your API key, username, and password when setting up your account. The API key is separate from your login credentials. You must obtain the API key from Quivo or request it through the API key request process. If you need to request an API key or have questions about accessing The Connector Web App, contact Quivo support.
</Note>

## Set up authentication

After you have your API key, set up authentication to use The Connector API. You need:

- **API Key:** Your static API key provided by Quivo
- **Username:** Your Quivo account username, which is the same as your Connector Web App login
- **Password:** Your Quivo account password, which is the same as your Connector Web App login

Your username and password are the same credentials you use to log in to The Connector Web App.

The [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) in the API reference provides detailed authentication instructions. The [Making your first API call](/docs/getting-started/first-api-call) tutorial shows you how to make your first API call.

## Verify your setup

Test your account setup by making a basic API call. The [Making your first API call](/docs/getting-started/first-api-call) tutorial shows you how to authenticate and verify your connection using the `GET /ping` endpoint.
