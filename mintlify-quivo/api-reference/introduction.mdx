## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using:

1. **Static API Key:** Obtained through the Quivo Dashboard. Include it in the `X-Api-Key` header.
2. **Session Token:** Obtained through the `POST /login` endpoint, valid for one hour. Include it in the `Authorization` header.

See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) for detailed instructions on obtaining and using session tokens.
