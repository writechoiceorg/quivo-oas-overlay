title: Track an Order
ogDescription: Retrieve the current status and tracking information for a fulfillment order
---

This guide shows you how to programmatically check if an order has been shipped and retrieve the carrier's tracking link to share with your customer.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Session Token:** A valid session token. See the [Authentication guide](/docs/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Order ID:** The unique integer `orderId` returned when you created the order. Use the [`GET /orders` endpoint](/docs/api-reference/introduction) in the API Reference to find it.

## Retrieve order details

To track an order, retrieve its full details using its unique ID via the [`GET /orders/{orderId}` endpoint](/docs/api-reference/introduction).

A successful request returns a 200 OK status. The response body contains the order's current state. Focus on two specific sections: the status and the tracking information.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request">
    Use the following request to retrieve the current status of your order:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "${BASE_URL}/orders/<YOUR_ORDER_ID>" \
      -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL before running requests and replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response">
    A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code.

    ```json
    {
      "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>,
      "orderIdentifier": "<YOUR_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>",
      "orderReference": "<YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE>",
      "orderStatus": "<ORDER_STATUS>",
      "orderDate": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "completedAt": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ>",
      "shippingMethodName": "<SHIPPING_METHOD_NAME>",
      "shipmentTracking": [
        {
          "number": "<TRACKING_NUMBER>",
          "link": "<TRACKING_LINK>"
        }
      ],
      "positions": [
        {
          "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
          "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
          "quantity": <QUANTITY>
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Locate the `orderStatus` field in the response body. This field indicates where the order is in the fulfillment lifecycle.

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `PENDING` | The order has been received but processing has not yet started. |
    | `PROCESSING` | The warehouse is currently picking and packing the items. |
    | `COMPLETED` | The order has been packed and handed over to the carrier. |
    | `CANCELLED` | The order was cancelled before fulfillment. |

    Once the status changes to `COMPLETED`, the system generates tracking information. Find this in the `shipmentTracking` array.

    - `number`: The tracking number assigned by the carrier.
    - `link`: A direct URL to the carrier's tracking page.
