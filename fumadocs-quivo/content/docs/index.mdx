Quivo is a 3PL founded in 2017 from the merger of LOGSTA and ANCLA (PackAngels), serving 1,500+ brands with its own network of six fulfillment centers (Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States) and partner hubs with GWC Group in the Gulf (Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman). 

We combine logistics operations with the Quivo Connector to provide end-to-end e-commerce integrations and management for our clients. Our platform manages the complete order lifecycle from inventory management to doorstep delivery through a 360° fulfillment software with 40+ shop system integrations (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Amazon FBM, TikTok, Wix, Shopware, PrestaShop, and more) and support for major providers (Royal Mail, DHL, DPD, FedEx) with flexible shipping options and real-time tracking.

## API integration

Quivo offers a comprehensive API to manage your inventory, orders, and shipments. This API is available for all our clients to use, and is the backbone of our platform. The following guides walk you through the main workflows for integrating with Quivo. You can find the API reference [here](/docs/api-reference/introduction).
