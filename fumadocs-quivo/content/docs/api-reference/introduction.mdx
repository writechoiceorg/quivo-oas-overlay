Welcome to the Quivo API Developer Portal. We offer a comprehensive REST API designed to provide seamless integration with our logistics and fulfillment platform. This documentation is structured to support your integration journey, from initial setup to detailed implementation.

## Your Path to Integration

We recommend following these steps for a smooth integration experience:

1. **Start with Authentication** to understand how to authenticate your requests. This is the essential first step before making any API calls.
2. **Follow the Quickstart Guides** to learn the main workflows for managing inventory, orders, and shipments.
3. **Explore the API Reference** to find the specific endpoints you need for your application.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using:

1. **Static API Key:** Obtained through the Quivo Dashboard. Include it in the `X-Api-Key` header.
2. **Session Token:** Obtained through the `POST /login` endpoint, valid for one hour. Include it in the `Authorization` header.

See the [Authentication guide](/docs/api-reference/authentication) for detailed instructions on obtaining and using session tokens.
